# Flutter Project Structure - Complete Explanation

This guide explains every file in your Flutter project and what it does.

## 📁 Root Directory Files

### `pubspec.yaml`
**What it is:** This is like a "shopping list" for your app.
- Lists all the packages (libraries) your app needs to work
- Defines your app's name and version number
- Tells Flutter what resources (images, fonts) to include
- **Think of it as:** The ingredients list for a recipe

**Key parts:**
- `name: dental_scanner` - Your app's internal name
- `dependencies:` - External packages your app uses (like ARCore plugin, camera plugin)
- `dev_dependencies:` - Tools only used during development (like code linters)
- `flutter:` - Flutter-specific settings

---

### `README.md`
**What it is:** A text file that explains what your project is about.
- Contains instructions for other developers (or future you!)
- Explains how to set up and run the project
- **Think of it as:** The instruction manual for your app

---

### `.gitignore`
**What it is:** A list of files and folders that should NOT be saved to version control.
- Prevents uploading temporary files, build artifacts, and local settings
- **Think of it as:** A "do not track" list for Git

**Why it's important:** It keeps your repository clean and prevents sharing sensitive or unnecessary files.

---

### `analysis_options.yaml`
**What it is:** Rules for code quality checking.
- Tells Flutter how to check your code for errors and style issues
- Helps maintain consistent code style
- **Think of it as:** Grammar and spell-check rules for your code

---

## 📁 `lib/` Directory

This folder contains all your Dart code (the programming language Flutter uses).

### `lib/main.dart`
**What it is:** The starting point of your app - like the "ON" button.
- The first file that runs when your app launches
- Contains the `main()` function - this is where everything begins
- Sets up the app's basic structure and theme
- **Think of it as:** The main door to your house

**What it does:**
1. `main()` - This function starts your app
2. `DentalScannerApp` - A widget that sets up the overall app structure
3. `HomeScreen` - The first screen users see when they open the app
4. Currently shows a welcome screen - we'll replace this with the camera/ARCore view later

## 📁 `android/` Directory

This folder contains all Android-specific code and configuration.

### `android/build.gradle`
**What it is:** Build configuration for the entire Android project.
- Defines build tools versions (like Gradle and Kotlin versions)
- Sets up where to download dependencies from
- **Think of it as:** The construction blueprint for building your Android app

---

### `android/settings.gradle`
**What it is:** Tells Gradle (the build system) how to organize the project.
- Specifies which modules to include
- Sets up the Flutter plugin system
- **Think of it as:** The table of contents for your build system

---

### `android/app/build.gradle`
**What it is:** Build configuration specifically for your app.
- Defines your app's package name (like `com.example.dental_scanner`)
- Sets minimum Android version (24 = Android 7.0, required for ARCore)
- Configures app version numbers
- **Think of it as:** The detailed blueprint for your specific app building

**Important settings:**
- `minSdkVersion 24` - Your app requires Android 7.0 or newer (ARCore requirement)
- `applicationId` - Your app's unique identifier on the Play Store

---

### `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
**What it is:** The "identity card" and permission request form for your app.
- Lists all permissions your app needs (like camera access)
- Defines your app's name, icon, and main activity
- Specifies hardware requirements (ARCore needs OpenGL ES 2.0+)
- **Think of it as:** Your app's passport and permission slip

**Key parts:**
- `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />` - Requests camera access
- `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.ar" />` - Declares ARCore requirement
- `minSdkVersion="24"` - Minimum Android version needed
- `MainActivity` - The main entry point for Android side

---

### `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/dental_scanner/MainActivity.kt`
**What it is:** The Android "entry point" written in Kotlin.
- This is the first Android code that runs
- Connects your Flutter app to the Android system
- Very minimal right now - just launches Flutter
- **Think of it as:** The bridge between Flutter and Android

**What it does:**
- `FlutterActivity` - A special Android activity that displays your Flutter app
- Later, we might add code here to handle ARCore initialization

---

## 📁 Generated/Future Files

### `.dart_tool/` (created automatically)
**What it is:** Flutter's internal tools and cache.
- Generated by Flutter automatically
- Contains temporary files used during development
- **You don't need to edit this** - Flutter manages it

### `build/` (created automatically)
**What it is:** Build output folder.
- Contains compiled code after you build your app
- Gets regenerated each time you build
- **You don't need to edit this**

## 🔄 How These Files Work Together

1. **You write code** in `lib/main.dart` (and other files in `lib/`)
2. **Flutter reads** `pubspec.yaml` to know what packages to use
3. **Android system reads** `AndroidManifest.xml` to know what permissions you need
4. **Build system** uses the `.gradle` files to compile everything
5. **MainActivity.kt** launches your Flutter app on Android

## 🎯 For Your Dental Scanner App

**Current State:**
- ✅ Basic Flutter app structure is ready
- ✅ Android permissions for camera are declared
- ✅ Minimum Android version set for ARCore support
- ⏳ ARCore integration (coming in next steps)
- ⏳ Camera preview (coming in next steps)
- ⏳ 3D mesh reconstruction (coming in later steps)

**Next Steps:**
1. Add ARCore plugin to `pubspec.yaml`
2. Implement camera preview in `lib/main.dart`
3. Add ARCore session management
4. Implement point cloud collection
5. Add mesh reconstruction algorithms

## 💡 Beginner Tips

1. **Don't modify** files in `android/` unless you know what you're doing
2. **Most of your work** will be in the `lib/` folder
3. **When adding features**, you'll update `pubspec.yaml` first to add packages
4. **Always read error messages** - they usually tell you what's wrong
5. **Use version control** (Git) to save your progress
